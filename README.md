❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Model
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction Model that predicts the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on medical attributes. The goal is to demonstrate the application of data science in healthcare and showcase how predictive analytics can help in early diagnosis and prevention.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Multiple classification models for prediction

Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Interactive and reproducible workflow in Jupyter Notebook

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains patient health parameters such as:

Age
